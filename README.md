# Career Foundry Achievement 1 Project: JavaScript App
## Overview
Following the Career Foundry cirriculum, I will be building a small web app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables veiwing of data points in detail. This repo is for my own personal learning. It has been made public to allow my tutor & mentor to check my work. Do not expect to find anything particularly useful here if you just happened to stumble across this project. ;-)
